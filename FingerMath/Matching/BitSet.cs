    /// This class can be thought of in two ways.  You can see it as a vector of bits or as a set of non-negative integers. The name
    /// <code>BitSet</code> is a bit misleading.
    /// 
    /// It is implemented by a bit vector, but its equally possible to see it as set of non-negative integer; each integer in the set is
    /// represented by a set bit at the corresponding index. The size of this structure is determined by the highest integer in the set.
    /// 
    /// You can union, intersect and build (symmetric) remainders, by invoking the logical operations and, or, andNot, resp. xor.
    /// 
    /// This implementation is NOT synchronized against concurrent access from multiple threads. Specifically, if one thread is reading from a bitset
    /// while another thread is simultaneously modifying it, the results are undefined.
